# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In Project One, I analyzed the run-time and memory usage of various data structures, focusing on their efficiency in different scenarios. In Project Two, I developed a program to sort and print a list of courses in alphanumeric order.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Understanding data structures is crucial because they directly impact the efficiency of algorithms. I carefully selected data structures based on their performance characteristics to optimize my solutions.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I encountered challenges with optimizing the sorting algorithm in Project Two. By reviewing algorithmic strategies and testing different approaches, I was able to enhance the performance of my code.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
These projects have expanded my approach to software design by emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate data structures and algorithms. I've learned to consider both time and space complexity in my designs.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on these projects has improved my ability to write code that is maintainable and adaptable. I've focused on clear documentation, modular design, and adhering to coding standards to ensure my code is easy to understand and modify.
